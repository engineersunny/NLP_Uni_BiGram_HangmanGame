We recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",

The test set should contain 1000 word types, and the rest should be in the  training set.

    "**Instructions:** The length of the secret word is an important clue that we might exploit. Different lengths tend to have different distributions over characters, e.g., short words are less likely to have suffixes or prefixes. You should incorporate this idea by conditioning the unigram model on the length of the secret word, i.e.,  having a **different unigram model for each length**. You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training. In such a case, your method should behave like the previous `unigram_guesser` in Question 3 (i.e., it guesses characters based on unigram frequencies, unconditioned by the word length).\n",

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",

    "To determine the best guess, this approach uses n-gram counts of letters. I implemented n-grams from 1 (unigram), 2 (bigram) up to 5 (five-gram). 'Five' is the chosen cutoff because most of the 6 and above letter sequences begin to be just a chain of smaller sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "For all words of test data, I used a few steps as below.\n",
    " \n",
    "First, all blanks (underscores separated by spaces) are fed to the function to guess the first letter. For example, \"hangman\" is converted to \"_ _ _ _ _ _ _\". Any correctly guessed letter will be blank, and this new string is passed for the next guess. A new string passed from the previous stage find any potential n-grams. For example, a unigram can be anywhere if there is any single blank space. A bigram can be either 'letter-blank' and 'blank-letter' such as '_ h' or 'h _'. Therefore a single blank space can be multiple n-grams. If the current status of the word is \"h a _ g m an\", the blank space is a unigram, bigram (for both \"a \" and \" g\"), trigram (\"h a \", \"a _ g\", \" g m\"), four-gram and five-gram.\n",
    "For each blank, a vector of probabilities for each letter not yet guessed is tabulated by calculating the frequencies of each n-gram, with more weight given to larger n. The letter with the highest probability is taken as a guess word. With our training data, the average number of incorrect guess showed 5.935 which is a fairly good result.\n",
